## Instructions
1.   Break into teams of 2-3 people, one workstation per team.
2.   Preparation - Each team writes down on paper the 10-20 demo-able user stories ("slices") they will develop and possibly demo. Each should be doable in 3-8 minutes. No slice is just mockup of UI, creation of a data table or data structure. All demos show real input & output (not test harness).
3.   Discussion - Instructor/facilitator leads discussion of the slices, what is and isn't acceptable, solicits ways to slice finer.
4.   Development - A fixed time-box of 40 minutes, five 8-minute development sprints, clock does not stop. At the end of each sprint, each team shows its product to another team.
5.	Debrief
